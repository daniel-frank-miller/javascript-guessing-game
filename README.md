# javascript-guessing-game

> You don't know JavaScript

## Description

React, Flux, Angular, Aurelia, TypeScript, Flow, oh my! By trying to make things simpler, I have created this game to stay on top of JavaScript in 2016.

[Live Demo](https://javascript-game.firebaseapp.com/)

Inspired by [How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.6m8kr3ema).
